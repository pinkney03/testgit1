Re: Dr. Wei Wu Reference Letter. To: Whom it may concern,

This recommendation letter is written to support the immigration petition of Wei Wu M.D., Ph.D., currently at the University of Washington. Dr. Wu is unquestionably a leader in her field with extraordinary research capabilities and international recognition as a top scientist. I have no hesitation and am honored to serve as her independent reference based on our common research interests of clinical diagnostic radiology and quantitative imaging. Moreover, Dr. Wu has made significant scientific contributions to these areas of research. In this letter, I hope to highlight the value of Dr. Wu’s work to the United States of America and bring recognition to the University as well as her research skills will continue to offer tangible benefits to the people of this country.
By way of introduction, I have served on the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine for 22 years, and currently hold the position of Professor in the Department of Radiology with a secondary appointment in Oncology. I am the Director of the Imaging Response Assessment and Biopsy Management Team of Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. I earned my PhD in Biomedical Physics from Joint Oakland University/Henry Ford Hospital Rochester, Michigan. I am Board Certified in Diagnostic Medical Physics by the American Board of Radiology and serve on the National Board of the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) Radiomics committee. I am one of the principal investigators on Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) that is a major initiative from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). QIN has been leading the cutting-edge research of new cancer imaging methods. I serve on the editorial boards of Radiology and Medical Physics. I am veteran of the Iraq war and in the U.S. Air Force for 13 years before I started my academic career. My current interests are the development and application of innovative CT, PET, and MRI methods as well was Machine and Deep Learning with radiomic tools for novel tumor metrics. I have served as the PI or co-investigators of more than $20 million grants. Given my experience in the research areas between Dr. Wei Wu and me, I believe I am qualified to judge her qualifications independently.
Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide and an estimated 14,480 women are diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer in the United States in 2021. About one third of cervical cancer treatment fails due to several causes, such as tumor heterogeneity. Tumor heterogeneity describes tumor differences, such as cellular morphology, gene expression, metabolism, and between cancer cells within a tumor among different patients. Understanding tumor heterogeneity is key critical area of research in cancer science. Because the differences between cells within a tumor microenvironment and this can be helpful in how cancers are diagnosed and treated. The higher the diversity of cells within a tumor, the bigger the risk that the cells might be able to adapt to a certain kind of treatment. If those cells go on to multiply and seed new cancer growth, it can potentially produce a therapy-resistant tumor. Therefore, to identify and quantify tumor heterogeneity greatly impact patient- specific response to cancer therapy.
In order to improve the success rate in cancer treatment, the key is to develop clinical evaluation method for assessing tumor heterogeneity and predicting treatment effect early. If treatment failure is predicted early, different types of therapy options can be considered to substantially improve the treatment response and outcome. However, current established clinical evaluation criteria are lacking and the sensitivity to quantify tumor heterogeneity and predict ultimate treatment failure early for different groups of patients. Two major contributions made by Dr. Wu on cancer treatment are: (1) establishment of a general radiomics framework to identify and quantify longitudinal patient-specific tumor heterogeneity; and (2) accurately and noninvasively predict cancer treatment effect at the early stage of therapy or even before the therapy is applied.
To predict cancer treatment accurately and develop effective therapy, the first task is the accurate identification and quantification of tumor heterogeneity. Dr. Wu developed a robust and noninvasive multimodality framework to quantify tumor heterogeneity in cervical cancer at different treatment stages using a series of imaging tools: dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). By incorporating anatomic and functional/biologic images, her framework extracts imaging spatial metrics of cellularity (through DWI-MRI), vascularity (through DCE-MRI) and metabolic activity (through PET/CT). These adequate metrics noninvasively provide accurate information of tumor heterogeneity and a unique opportunity to longitudinally assess tumor changes after treatment. Dr. Wu’s framework is now being introduced with the application of brachytherapy (a type of internal radiation therapy) paradigm in a clinical trial. So far, this framework has exhibited a profound impact on the management of individual cancer patients by providing early prediction of treatment outcome and designing tailored therapy for each patient.
It is worth noting that Dr. Wu’s work was the first study to characterize DCE MRI, DWI, and FDG PET imaging features of cervical cancer heterogeneity and cancer changes during therapy. Dr. Wu’s extraordinary framework was proved successful on 21 patients in clinical trial and the influence of the framework is beyond cervical cancer. Her framework exhibited excellent sensitivity and specificity with much higher diagnostic accuracy was achieved compared to using previous methods. The exceptional results were published in a top leading journal, and I cited Dr. Wu’s work as follows: “In the breast lesions, consistent with other reports in breast and other cancers, malignant breast lesions had increased entropy or heterogeneity compared to benign lesions. Importantly, no differences in the normal glandular tissue were noted between patients with either benign and malignant lesions.” This is direct evidence showing Dr. Wu’s framework provided complementary evidence for outcome prediction of breast cancer therapy.
Another major outcome of Dr. Wu’s framework was the identification of a set of valuable intensity histogram features (FDG-PET SUV CoV, DW-MRI ADC skewness) as radiomics biomarkers to predict treatment response. By correlating the patient-specific tumor heterogeneity features with the patient’s response at multiple treatment time points (pre-RT, early-RT (2 weeks), and mid-RT (5 weeks)), these biomarkers were employed to supervise the therapy effect at the early stage. With such detailed scientific evidence, the tumor heterogeneity information among different patients and time-points were derived. The derived information is integrated into current clinical workflows through standardized reporting of radiomic features, analogous to genomic and proteomic features. Besides, causal relationships among these features were characterized on a patient-specific basis, leading to future omics analyses of imaging and tissue biomarkers of tumor heterogeneity. With all these features and analytics results, clinical decisions can be made to develop a comprehensive radiomic assessment of changing tumor heterogeneity as the guide for developing personalized treatment and predicting treatment outcome. For example, therapeutic intervention and novel therapy development regarding selection of dose, radiation length and intensity were designed by clinicians based on individual patients’ characteristics (ethics, age, tumor types and development stages, etc.). Combining with physician’s clinical experience, with biomarkers from Dr. Wu’s framework may overcome the limitations of conventional clinical practice. However, over time the clinicians will hopefully become more confident to adjust treatment for achieving best treatment outcome. This will be tested in prospective studies.
For another influential work, I would like to highlight Dr. Wu’s contribution to the development in understanding COVID-19 patients. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Wu has also utilized medical imaging resources to analyze the clinical and imaging characteristics of pulmonary embolisms (PE) in COVID-19 patients. Pulmonary embolism can occur when a primary artery within the lung is blocked by blood clots and the presentation of physical symptoms are similar to that of both COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In order to raise awareness of the prevalence of PEs in COVID-19 patients, Dr. Wu published a series of important case reports investigating PEs in COVID-19 patients who experience hypoxemia or severe dyspnea using computed tomography (CT). CT imaging is the standard of care to assess the features of PEs in COVID-19 patients and her work resulted key information on the understanding of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients complicated with PEs. Dr. Wu reported that ARDS appears to be correlated with PEs in COVID-19 patients. Her imaging findings are extremely beneficial in the current health crisis and help physicians and radiologists to recognize the risk factors of ARDS and PEs within COVID-19 patients. Dr. Wu has rapidly published her findings on this topic, and her work was subsequently implemented into a study by Gravell et al. and utilized her observations of increased PE rates to help elucidate the development of hypercoagulable and pro-coagulopathic states in COVID-19 patients. Later more accumulating evidence in COVID-19 patients supported Dr. Wu’s discovery. For example, an article titled “Pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia” from a top respiratory journal: Eur Respir J and another article “Pulmonary Embolism in COVID-19 Patients: Awareness of an Increased Prevalence” from top cardiovascular journal both reported the same findings described by Dr. Wu. Thus, Dr. Wu’s research has already proven to be a key addition to ongoing studies of COVID-19 in the radiology field.
As a board-certified medical physicist working in the medical imaging field for over 20 years, I am confident to say that Dr. Wei Wu’s research has advanced the medical imaging for diagnosis, treatment evaluation and medical intervention both at fundamental and translational levels. Overall, Dr. Wu has exhibited a very impressive academic record throughout her research career. The successes made by Dr. Wu indicate that she has obtained the ideal scientific background to make continued contributions to enhance radiology technology advancement for cancer treatment, fight the global COVID-19 outbreak, add value to the economy and promote human health. All these facts are strong evidence of Dr. Wu’s credentials as a top medical scientist in her field. I strongly believe that she has made and will continue to make significant scientific contributions to her dedicated fields. I will be pleased to provide additional information in support of Dr. Wu’s petition if required.

Sincerely yours,
